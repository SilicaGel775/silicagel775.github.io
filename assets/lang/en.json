      "description": "Low order harmonics of most instruments, generally viewed as the bass presence range. Boosting a signal around 300 Hz adds clarity to the bass and lower-stringed instruments. Too much boost around 500 Hz can make higher-frequency instruments sound muffled."

      "width": "10%",

      "width": "5.9%",
      "description": "The presence range is responsible for the clarity and definition of a sound. Over-boosting can cause an irritating, harsh sound. Cutting in this range makes the sound more distant and transparent."
