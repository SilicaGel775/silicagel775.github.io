      "name": "Bass",
      "description": "Determins how \"fat\" or \"thin\" the sound is, boosting around 250hz tend to add a feeling of warmth. If you're a bass head you most likely like this range."
    },
    {
      "name": "Lower Mids",
      "description": "Low order harmonics of most instruments, generally viewed as the bass presence range. Boosting a signal around 300 Hz adds clarity to the bass and lower-stringed instruments. Too much boost around 500 Hz can make higher-frequency instruments sound muffled."
    },
    {
      "name": "Midrange",
      "description": "The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn-like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue."
    },
    {
      "name": "Upper Mids",
      "description": "The high midrange is responsible for the attack on percussive and rhythm instruments. If boosted, this range can add presence. However, too much boost around the 3 kHz range can cause listening fatigue."
    },
    {
      "name": "Presence",
      "description": "The presence range is responsible for the clarity and definition of a sound. Over-boosting can cause an irritating, harsh sound. Cutting in this range makes the sound more distant and transparent."
    },
    {
      "name": "Brilliance",
      "description": "The brilliance range is composed entirely of harmonics and is responsible for sparkle and air of a sound. Over boosting in this region can accentuate hiss and cause ear fatigue."
    },
    {
      "name": "Non-Confidence Interval",
      "description": "An interval where relative comparisons between measurements are not problematic, but unreliable due to the nature of IEC 60318-4 (711) measurement equipment. This is where the over-represented resonance peak of 711 begins, and is also the main reason why FR measurements obtained by controlling the insertion depth are slightly different from what is perceived due to the inconsistent insertion depth of the earphones in real listening environments."
